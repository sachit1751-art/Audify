 * from the phone's own APK (see app/build.gradle.kts), and Android refuses an
 * update whose versionCode is lower than the one installed.
 *
 * No "v" in the name — the in-app updater reads it as a number; the "v" is the

/*
 * Bump this by hand before cutting each sideloaded test build ("beta2",
 * "beta3", ...) and blank it out before cutting the real release. Marks the
 * versionName above as a pre-release: AppUpdateChecker.isNewer() treats any
 * "-suffix" as older than a clean release of the same number, so testers
 * still get the update prompt once the matching tag is actually published.
 *
 * Applied to release builds as well as debug ones, and that is the whole
 * point of it. A sideloaded beta is a *release* build — signed with the real
 * key, installed over the real package — so leaving the marker off it is
 * exactly the case that strands a tester: their build calls itself 1.6.1,
 * the published 1.6.1 then matches it, isNewer() says no, and no prompt ever
 * comes. Blanking this line is the one step that turns a beta into a release,
 * so it is the one place to get right.
 *
 * The watch app carries the same marker. It needs no prompt logic of its own:
 * the phone compares the watch's installed APK with the one it carries, so a
 * beta watch app shows "Update available" as soon as the phone has the release.
